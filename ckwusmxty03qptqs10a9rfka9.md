### Step3: Clone repository

You can clone the repository by clicking the drop-down button and copying the URL

```
git clone "copied URL"

```
For e.g.

```
git clone "https://github.com/RanawatTech/Android_Frontend_Java.git"

```
Here, Android_Frontend_Java is the name of the original repository now it is locally cloned to your device.

```
cd Android_Frontend_Java

```

The Android_Frontend_Java is your folder name. Now create a branch using the git checkout command:

```
git checkout -b add "branch name"

```

E.g.

```
git checkout -b new_branch

```

Here the new branch is the name of the branch you can give any name it is up to you.


### Step 4: Commit


Now, you can make necessary changes, e.g. You can create a folder called Blog/README.md and insert some text, code and save the file, Now move back to the terminal and give the command

```
git status

```

Now, it lists out the changes you have made.

```
git add 

```

This command helps to add all the changes you have made

```
git commit -m "first commit"

```

This command helps you to commit all the changes you have made to the file, It is not necessary you should name it as the first commit you can also name it as


```
git commit -m "new_branch - readme"

```

The new branch represents your branch name and the readme is the name of your file.


### Step 5: Push Changes

Until now the changes have not been added to the GitHub repository,


```
git push -u origin <add-your-branch-name>

```

E.g.

```
git push -u origin new_branch

```

### Step 6: Submit your changes for review

This is the step where you inform the owner of the repo to accept the changes, which is called PR - Pull request, After pushing the changes move to your cloned repo and refresh the page

Now comment on your changes e.g. I had fixed the readme file and clicked the create a pull request. Soon when the owner merges all your changes into the master or main branch of the project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.

Bravo! You completed the standard workflow issue ->fork -> clone -> edit -> pull request, Now you can start contributing to open-source projects.
